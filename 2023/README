# Advent of Code 2023

Completed the first 9 days before getting distracted with...work :)

The problems were solved in the Scala 3 repl, and then translated to runnable files with minimal code golfing, just basic cleanup to make the code readable.

Days 5 and 8 were probably the most challenging.

Scala and its excellent collections library are, IMO, ideally suited to tackling these types of problems without relying on `var` and other mutable constructs.
`foldLeft` was especially useful, along with `intersect`, `diff`, and standard `flatMap`/`map`. Regular expression support and the ability to pattern match on regexes was also quite helpful.

In short, Scala rocks.
